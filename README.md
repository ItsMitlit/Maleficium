# Maleficium: Vampires, Magic & More!
Welcome to Maleficium! This mod gives players the ability to become vampires with various different abilities, buffs, and debuffs. Please be patient with me and aware that this mod is in **early beta** and I'm uploading this to get [feedback](https://github.com/ItsMitlit/Maleficium/issues) and possible [contributions](https://github.com/ItsMitlit/Maleficium) so that I can make a better finished product.

## Features
- This mod adds the ability to become a vampire `/setspecies vampire` with various different abilities. Other species such as **werewolves** and **witches** will be introduced in future updates.

## Current Abilities
The vampire abilities can currently be found in the keybinds under the **MCLegacies** heading. Such abilities include:
- **Compulsion** `v` - Compell a villager to give lower trade prices
    - Reduce villager prices by **50%**
    - Reduces hunger significantly.
- **Blood Sucking** `b` - Drink the blood of other **living** creatures and temporarily freeze them in place.
    - Only villagers give saturation.
    - Draining a mob to death gives a regeneration boost.
    - Mob blood count resets on world restart.
- **Movement Buffs** `n` - Increase your movement attributes through a keybind toggle.
    - Speed and jump power movement buffs.
- **Generic Buffs** - As a vampire, you will have constantly increased strength and health.
- **Daylight Intolerance** - Didn't you know? Vampires burn in the daylight! In order to prevent this, you're going to need a **daylight ring**.

## Compatability
**[Curios API](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios)** - *optional*
- Daylight Ring ring slot
