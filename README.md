# Maleficium: Vampires, Magic & More!
Welcome to Maleficium! This mod gives players the ability to become vampires with various different abilities, buffs, and debuffs. Please be patient with me and aware that this mod is in **early beta** and I'm uploading this to get [feedback](https://github.com/ItsMitlit/Maleficium/issues) and possible [contributions](https://github.com/ItsMitlit/Maleficium) so that I can make a better finished product.

### Side Note
This mod uses themes and ideas from various books, films, ideas, etc. I may add a mechanic or feature in a similar way to one story and another from a completely different one.

## Features
- This mod adds the ability to become a vampire `/setspecies vampire` with various different abilities. Other species such as **werewolves** and **witches** will be introduced in future updates.
- From **v1.0.0-beta2** and up, you can become a vampire by being killed by a witch. (50% chance)
- From **v1.0.0-beta3** and up, we now have documentation powered by the [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) mod.

The vampire abilities can currently be found in the keybinds under the **Maleficium** heading. Such abilities include:
